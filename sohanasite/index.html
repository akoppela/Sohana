					<h2>Meditation</h2>

					<p>In our society there is a certain stereotype about Meditation. I want to dispel this myth: the practice of meditation can be both passive and active. Most people have heard only of passive meditation involving motionless sitting. Not every average person in the world can sink into a passive meditation. Our restless and unruly mind will not allow itself so silenced easily. Therefore, there is dynamic meditation to calm the mind through the active work with the body. These practices are also referred to as energy practices. I would like to introduce these methods to you.<br><br>

					<p>Nowadays, people are increasingly aware of the need to pay more attention to their bodies, in order to be able to relax and relieve growing internal tension. The human body keeps the memory of all that has happened to it during a person’s life. These memories can have a positive or negative impact on our well-being, and ultimately on the quality and usefulness of our lives. Since ancient times, people have known that correct manipulation of the body can solve many problems - both physical and psychological. 
The unity of mind, body and emotions means that disease in one domain can affect the others.<br><br>
