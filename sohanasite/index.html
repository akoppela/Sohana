					<h2>Welcome to a world of <br> yoga, meditation and massage</h2>

					<h2>Meditation</h2>
					<span class="ps-price">S</span>
					<div class="Hid">
					<p>In our society there is a certain stereotype about Meditation. I want to dispel this myth: the practice of meditation can be both passive and active. Most people have heard only of passive meditation involving motionless sitting. Not every average person in the world can sink into a passive meditation. Our restless and unruly mind will not allow itself so silenced easily. Therefore, there is dynamic meditation to calm the mind through the active work with the body. These practices are also referred to as energy practices. I would like to introduce these methods to you.<br>
					Kundalini – is a dynamic meditation technique developed by Osho Rajneesh. When you go into meditation – Kundalini shaking, let it happen rather than do it. Stand silently, feel it coming, and when your body starts to tremble a little – help it, but without strong-willed efforts. Enjoy it, feel the bliss, let it happen, welcome it and keep it. If you’re forcing it you will only exercise your physical body. The shaking will be, but only on the surface, it will unlikely penetrate into your depths. You will remain solid – stone-like inside, you’ll become a manipulator, a doer, and the body will simply follow you.</p>

Thai massage (yoga-massage) - is a holistic system of healing that uses a number of principles and techniques to influence health such as deep pressure on muscle tissue, passive exercise, postures reminiscent of those used in yoga, muscle and ligament stretching, soft opening of joints, and energy flow activation through impact on energy lines and acupuncture points. This kind of massage is very effective for the recovery of the musculoskeletal system, helping to restore mobility to the spine and joints. 
<br>

Most of this bodily In practice, Thai Massage resembles a passive yoga: it uses stretching, twisting and pressing with the fingers, palms, elbows, knees and feet and is administered in comfortable clothes, lying on a mat. 
<br>

During a massage session smooth, deep and gentle movements are applied at the same measured pace, gradually changing the electrical activity of the brain, taking it to a slower mode. 
<br>
Every part of the body is worked on from the heels up to the crown, restoring harmony and balance to all its systems.
The session ends with a facial massage, removing the last signs of stress, reflected in the form of facial grimaces and wrinkles, returning a relaxed look to the face, and leaving patients feeling relaxed, refreshed and energized.
